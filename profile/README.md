# IT 140
Welcome to the IT 140 organization. This repository contains a collection of projects that I have developed as part of the IT 140 course at Southern New Hampshire University. This course served as an introduction to programming, with a focus on the Python language. Throughout this class, I developed foundational programming skills, learning the basics of Python and how to apply these concepts to build functional software applications.

# About the Course
IT 140 is an introductory course in computer science that focuses on the fundamentals of programming using Python. The course covers a wide range of topics essential for beginners, including variables, data types, decision branching, loops, functions, and basic object-oriented programming. The projects within this organization reflect the culmination of my learning and practical application of these fundamental concepts.

# Key Topics Covered
- Introduction to Programming, Variables & Expressions: The basics of programming and how to define and manipulate variables and expressions in Python.
- Data Types & Strings: Understanding the different data types in Python, with a focus on working with strings.
- Decision Branching: Implementing conditional logic to allow programs to make decisions based on user input or other data.
- Loops: Using loops to repeat actions, iterate over data, and perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
- Functions: Defining and using functions to organize code into reusable blocks.
- Lists & Dictionaries: Managing collections of data using Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures.
- Files: Reading from and writing to files to handle persistent data storage.
- Classes & Modules: Introduction to object-oriented programming concepts, including how to create and use classes and modules.

# What You'll Find in This Organization
This organization contains the following repository:
- Text-Based Adventure Game: A Python project where I developed a simple text-based adventure game. This project required applying all the fundamental concepts learned throughout the course, including loops, functions, decision branching, and basic object-oriented programming principles.

# Why These Projects Matter
The projects in this repository were designed to help me understand the core concepts of programming and provide a strong foundation for more advanced studies. They demonstrate my ability to:
- Write clean, efficient, and maintainable Python code.
- Develop solutions that meet specified functional requirements.
- Apply programming principles effectively to solve basic problems.
- Work with data structures and manage input/output operations.

# Future Applications
The skills I developed through these projects are highly transferable to other areas of software development. Whether it's working with more advanced programming languages, tackling more complex algorithms, or developing larger-scale applications, the foundation built in IT 140 will serve as a strong base for future endeavors.

Reflection
Through the IT 140 course, I gained a solid understanding of the fundamentals of programming with Python. The hands-on projects challenged me to apply what I learned in practical scenarios, enhancing my problem-solving skills and preparing me for more advanced programming courses. These foundational skills will be invaluable as I continue to grow as a developer.
